Your task is to extract action items from meeting notes.

For each action item, identify:
1. Description: What needs to be done (be specific)
2. Assignee: Who is responsible (if mentioned)
3. Due Date: When it needs to be completed (if mentioned)
4. Priority: High, medium, or low based on language used
5. Status: Always set to "pending" for new extractions

Look for phrases like:
- "Action item:", "TODO:", "Task:", "Follow up:"
- "[Name] will...", "[Name] to...", "[Name] should..."
- "Assigned to [Name]", "@[Name]"
- "By [date]", "Due [date]", "Deadline:"
- "ASAP", "urgent", "critical", "high priority"

Be conservative - only extract clear action items, not general discussion points.
