## Workshop Branches

This repository uses multiple branches for different workshop paths and checkpoints:
- `main`: Main documentation and workshop overview
- `path-*/start`: Starting point with TODOs for each path
- `path-*/checkpoint-1`: First checkpoint (basic functionality)
- `path-*/checkpoint-2`: Second checkpoint (AI integration)
- `path-*/checkpoint-3`: Third checkpoint (full features)

### Branch-Specific Fixes

When fixing content on workshop branches (path-a/start, etc.), changes are pushed directly to those branches rather than merged through main, as each branch represents a specific workshop state.
