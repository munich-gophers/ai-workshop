GO-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:

Focus on these common Go issues:
- Unhandled errors (every function returning error should be checked)
- Goroutine leaks (missing context cancellation or WaitGroup)
- Race conditions (shared state without mutex or channels)
- Inefficient string concatenation (use strings.Builder for loops)
- Exported types/functions without doc comments
- Use of interface{} when generics would be better (Go 1.18+)
- Missing defer for cleanup (files, connections, locks)
- Not checking context cancellation in long loops

Go best practices to recommend:
- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Keep interfaces small (1-3 methods ideal)
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Prefer table-driven tests
- Use meaningful variable names (not single letters except short loops)
- Return errors, don't panic (except for programmer errors)

Example good feedback:
BAD: "Add error handling"
GOOD: "Add error check after db.Query() on line 23: if err != nil { return fmt.Errorf(\"query failed: %w\", err) }"

BAD: "This could be faster"
GOOD: "Consider using strings.Builder instead of += in loop (lines 15-20) for better performance with large strings"
```
