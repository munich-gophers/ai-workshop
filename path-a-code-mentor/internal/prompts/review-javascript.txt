JAVASCRIPT-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:

Focus on these common JavaScript issues:
- Using var instead of let/const
- Not handling Promise rejections (missing .catch or try/catch with async/await)
- Comparing with == instead of ===
- Mutating function parameters
- Not using optional chaining (?.) for nested properties
- Memory leaks with event listeners

JavaScript best practices to recommend:
- Use const by default, let when reassignment needed, avoid var
- Prefer async/await over raw Promises for readability
- Use destructuring for cleaner code
- Avoid callback hell with Promises/async-await
- Use Array methods (map, filter, reduce) over for loops
- Consider TypeScript for larger codebases

Example good feedback:
BAD: "Use const"
GOOD: "Change 'var' to 'const' on line 12 since this value never changes. Use 'let' only when reassignment is needed"

BAD: "Handle errors"
GOOD: "Add .catch() to the Promise chain on line 25, or wrap in try/catch if using async/await to handle potential fetch failures"
