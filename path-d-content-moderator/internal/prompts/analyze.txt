Perform a comprehensive analysis of the following content, combining sentiment analysis and content moderation.

Your analysis should include:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
   - Confidence in your sentiment assessment
   - Sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0)

2. **Content Moderation**:
   - Safety assessment across all categories
   - Specific issues detected with confidence levels
   - Overall risk level

3. **Action Recommendation**:
   Based on the combined analysis, recommend one of the following actions:
   - **approve** - Content is safe and appropriate
   - **flag** - Content needs human review (moderate risk)
   - **reject** - Content violates policies (high risk)
   - **escalate** - Content requires immediate attention (critical risk)

For your recommendation, provide:
- The recommended action
- Confidence level in the recommendation (0.0 to 1.0)
- Clear reasoning for the recommendation
- Whether the action should be automatically executed (based on confidence)

Consider:
- Context and intent matter
- Negative sentiment doesn't always mean content should be rejected
- Positive sentiment doesn't guarantee content is appropriate
- Multiple moderate flags may warrant escalation
- High-confidence violations should be auto-rejected
